This player is designer using 
* Tkinter
* pillow
* pygame
* Shutil
* os
* datetime

The main thing is here that you ony need to add songs to the playlist from the location where they are stored and then you dont need to worry about any other thing they will be there in your playlist until you delete them from your system.This player will work smoothly even under the conditions of major errors.Even added key controls for smooth user experience.

# Role played by the libraries:
**Tkinter** is a globaly renound python library for building GUI based applications. It has very helpful tools that make designing and contructing of a real life apllication very easy. The library had a mojor role in this project as it is the foundation of all the actions that the user performs in the music player. The best thing is that, because this library is so flexible , I managed to make two windows run simultaneously, where by default the focus is always on one window at a time. There are certain minor things the developers ignore while creating an apllication using tkinter.But I managed to make this code run without erros.

**Pillow** is an image processing library, with very efficient capabilities and features to perform on images. There are'nt much images except the logo and the info window. I croped,cut and resised the image using the Image and ImageTk classes from pillow library.

**Pygame** has been playing the main role in this project. It is next to heart of the application. It is used in this project for playing music. play-pause, stop and rewind features are used from this library.

**OS** is an in built library that come with the python package when installed.It is used to do some file management in the project.

**datetime** it is a library that deals with doing manipulations with dates and times. It is used to extract the time user spending on the player.

This player also has info window for more details about the player.

Add music to the playlist using the **Add Music button**.

All the activities that you will perform will show up on the terminal. So you can check whats going on with the application.
